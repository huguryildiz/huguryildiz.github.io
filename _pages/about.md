## Associate Professor, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, TED University
### IEEE Senior Member

### Biography

Huseyin Ugur Yildiz is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at TED University, Ankara, Turkey, and a Senior Member of the IEEE.

He received his B.S. degree from Bilkent University (Ankara) in 2009 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from TOBB University of Economics and Technology (Ankara) in 2013 and 2016, respectively, all in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

From 2010 to 2015, he worked at Turk Telekom, and from 2015 to 2016 at Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), Ankara, where he contributed to the design of networking and communication architectures for several critical systems, including UAV platforms. He joined TED University in 2016 as an Assistant Professor and has been serving as an Associate Professor since 2021.

His research focuses on operations research and networked communication systems, with particular emphasis on routing, resource allocation, and energy efficiency in wireless ad hoc networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. His work is primarily grounded in optimization-based modeling and analysis, increasingly complemented by reinforcement learning techniques for decision-making in complex networked systems.

His current research interests also include extending these optimization and learning-based frameworks to quantum network routing, focusing on hybrid classical–quantum networking architectures. In this context, he investigates how constraints such as entanglement lifetime, network reliability, and resource availability reshape routing, control, and optimization strategies in next-generation communication networks.
