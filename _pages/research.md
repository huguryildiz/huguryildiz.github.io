- **Operations Research**
- **Meta-Heuristics**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

## Key Research Topics

### Maximization of Wireless Sensor Networks Lifetime via Linear Programming

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things. A typical WSN is composed of numerous battery-limited sensor nodes and a central sink node (base station). Sensor nodes periodically capture data about the environment and transfer the collected data to the sink node either by direct or multi-hop communication for further processing.

My research uses linear programming (LP) to maximize network lifetime (time until the first node depletes its battery), with flow variables representing how data is routed between nodes.

### Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks

I have extensively researched lifetime maximization in underwater acoustic sensor networks, considering unique challenges such as:
- Limited battery capacity
- Acoustic channel characteristics
- Void regions and connectivity issues
- Multi-sink architectures
- Security and reliability constraints

### Recent Research Directions

My current research increasingly incorporates:
- **Reinforcement Learning** for adaptive network optimization
- **Quantum Network Routing** in hybrid classical-quantum architectures
- **Machine Learning** techniques for parameter prediction and network optimization
