## Research Summary

My research focuses on the applications of optimization techniques (e.g., linear programming, mixed-integer programming, heuristics, etc.) for modeling and analyzing research problems on wireless communications and networks. More specifically:

- Ad Hoc Networks
- Wireless Sensor Networks
- Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks
- Internet of Things
- Smart Grids

are my favorite research areas.

## Maximization of Wireless Sensor Networks Lifetime via Linear Programming

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things. A typical WSN is composed of numerous battery-limited sensor nodes and a central sink node (base station). Sensor nodes periodically capture data about the environment and transfer the collected data to the sink node either by direct or multi-hop communication for further processing.

Terrestrial or underwater WSN lifetime can be maximized using linear programming (LP). In this setting, LP is used to maximize or minimize a linear objective under linear constraints. A common objective is maximizing network lifetime (time until the first node depletes its battery), with flow variables representing how data is routed between nodes.
