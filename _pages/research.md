## Research Summary

My research focuses on routing, resource allocation, and energy-efficient design of networked systems, with an emphasis on wireless ad hoc networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. I develop optimization-based models and increasingly combine them with reinforcement learning to address scalability and uncertainty.

More recently, I have been exploring hybrid classical–quantum network routing, investigating how physical constraints such as entanglement lifetime and network reliability influence routing and control decisions.

## Key Research Topics

### Operations Research and Mathematical Optimization for Networked Systems:

Development of linear, integer, and mixed-integer programming (MILP) models, including network flow–based formulations, for complex optimization problems arising in communication networks. Primary focus areas include network lifetime maximization, energy efficiency, resource allocation, energy–delay–reliability trade-offs, and resilience under physical, topological, and security constraints.

### Wireless Ad Hoc and Underwater Sensor Networks: 

Design and optimization of energy-efficient routing, topology control, and communication strategies for terrestrial wireless ad hoc networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. Research topics span network lifetime and energy-efficiency analysis, k-connectivity–based reliability, multi-sink architectures, void regions, adversarial effects (e.g., eavesdropping and sinkhole attacks), and operation under harsh and resource-constrained environments.

### Hybrid Optimization and Learning-Based Network Control:

Integration of mathematical optimization frameworks with machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to enable adaptive, data-driven, and scalable control of complex networked systems. Recent work explores hybrid optimization–learning methodologies for parameter prediction, dynamic decision-making, and emerging paradigms such as quantum network routing and hybrid classical–quantum architectures.
