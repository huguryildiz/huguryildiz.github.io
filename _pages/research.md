## Research Summary

My research focuses on the applications of optimization techniques (e.g., linear programming, mixed-integer programming, heuristics) for modeling and analyzing research problems in wireless communications and networks.

## Key Research Topics

### Maximization of Wireless Sensor Networks Lifetime via Linear Programming

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things. A typical WSN is composed of numerous battery-limited sensor nodes and a central sink node (base station). Sensor nodes periodically capture data about the environment and transfer the collected data to the sink node either by direct or multi-hop communication for further processing.

My research uses linear programming (LP) to maximize network lifetime (time until the first node depletes its battery), with flow variables representing how data is routed between nodes.

### Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks

I have extensively researched lifetime maximization in underwater acoustic sensor networks, considering unique challenges such as:
- Limited battery capacity
- Acoustic channel characteristics
- Void regions and connectivity issues
- Multi-sink architectures
- Security and reliability constraints

- **Operations Research and Mathematical Optimization for Networked Systems:**  
  Development of linear, integer, and mixed-integer programming (MILP) models, including network flow–based formulations, for complex optimization problems arising in communication networks. Primary focus areas include network lifetime maximization, energy efficiency, resource allocation, energy–delay–reliability trade-offs, and resilience under physical, topological, and security constraints.

- **Wireless Ad Hoc and Underwater Sensor Networks:**  
  Design and optimization of energy-efficient routing, topology control, and communication strategies for terrestrial wireless ad hoc networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. Research topics span network lifetime and energy-efficiency analysis, k-connectivity–based reliability, multi-sink architectures, void regions, adversarial effects (e.g., eavesdropping and sinkhole attacks), and operation under harsh and resource-constrained environments.

- **Hybrid Optimization and Learning-Based Network Control:**  
  Integration of mathematical optimization frameworks with machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to enable adaptive, data-driven, and scalable control of complex networked systems. Recent work explores hybrid optimization–learning methodologies for parameter prediction, dynamic decision-making, and emerging paradigms such as quantum network routing and hybrid classical–quantum architectures.

### Recent Research Directions

My current research increasingly incorporates:
- **Reinforcement Learning** for adaptive network optimization
- **Quantum Network Routing** in hybrid classical-quantum architectures
- **Machine Learning** techniques for parameter prediction and network optimization
