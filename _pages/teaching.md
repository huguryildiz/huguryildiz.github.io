## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy integrates **theory, practice, and active learning** to foster independent thinking and lifelong learning. I emphasize:

- Interactive classroom discussions that promote collaborative problem-solving  
- Two-stage collaborative quizzes combining group work with individual assessment  
- Use of modern computational tools (e.g., MATLAB, tablets) for live problem-solving and visualization  
- Connecting theoretical concepts to real-world engineering applications  
- Preparing students for both industry and research careers  

My goal is to create an engaging and supportive learning environment that helps students develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

## Student Supervision
