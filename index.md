## Biography
 
Huseyin Ugur Yildiz received the B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), Ankara, Turkey, in 2009, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from [TOBB University of Economics and Technology](https://www.etu.edu.tr/en), Ankara, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

Between 2010 and 2015, he worked at [Turk Telekom](https://www.turktelekom.com.tr/), where he contributed to the design and operation of the [Safer Internet Service](https://www.guvenlinet.org.tr/), a nationwide content-filtering and parental-control platform used by more than five million subscribers. From 2015 to 2016, he was with [Turkish Aerospace](https://www.tusas.com/), where he was involved in the development and integration of communication and network architectures for [ANKA](https://www.tusas.com/en/products/uav/operative-strategic-uav-systems/anka) unmanned aerial vehicle systems. He joined the [Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://ee.tedu.edu.tr/en) at [TED University](https://www.tedu.edu.tr/) in 2016, where he has been serving as an Associate Professor since 2021 and held the position of Department Chair from 2021 to 2024.

His research applies **operations research** and **mathematical optimization** to routing, resource allocation, and energy efficiency problems in **wireless ad hoc networks**, **underwater acoustic sensor networks**, and **drone-assisted aerial networks**. Recently, he has been advancing this framework by integrating mathematical optimization with **reinforcement learning** techniques. He is particularly interested in applying these hybrid optimization–learning methodologies to emerging paradigms such as **quantum network routing**, with an emphasis on hybrid classical–quantum architectures and the impact of physical constraints, including entanglement lifetime and network reliability, on routing and control decisions.

He has authored over 20 peer-reviewed journal articles with more than 1,000 citations, received the IEEE Middle East and North Africa Communications Conference 2019 Best Paper Award, and was elevated to IEEE Senior Member in 2021.
