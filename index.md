### About
 
Huseyin Ugur Yildiz received the B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), Ankara, Turkey, in 2009, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from [TOBB University of Economics and Technology](https://www.etu.edu.tr/en), Ankara, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

Between 2010 and 2015, he worked at [Turk Telekom](https://www.turktelekom.com.tr/), where he contributed to the design and operation of the Safer Internet Service, a nationwide platform used by more than five million subscribers. From 2015 to 2016, he was with [Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI)](https://www.tusas.com/), working on communication and network architectures for ANKA unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. He joined the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at [TED University](https://www.tedu.edu.tr/) in 2016, where he has been serving as an Associate Professor since 2021 and held the position of Department Chair from 2021 to 2024.

His research focuses on routing, resource allocation, and energy efficiency challenges in wireless ad hoc networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks, primarily through the development of optimization-based models. Recently, he has been advancing this framework by integrating mathematical optimization with reinforcement learning techniques. He is particularly interested in applying these hybrid optimization–learning methodologies to emerging paradigms such as quantum network routing, with an emphasis on hybrid classical–quantum architectures and the impact of physical constraints, including entanglement lifetime and network reliability, on routing and control decisions.

He has authored over 20 peer-reviewed journal articles with more than 1,000 citations, received the IEEE Middle East and North Africa Communications Conference (IEEE MENACOMM) 2019 Best Paper Award, and was elevated to IEEE Senior Member in 2021.

### Research Interests

- **Operations Research and Mathematical Optimization for Networked Systems:**  
  Development of linear, integer, and mixed-integer programming (MILP) models, including network flow–based formulations, for complex optimization problems arising in communication networks. Primary focus areas include network lifetime maximization, energy efficiency, resource allocation, energy–delay–reliability trade-offs, and resilience under physical, topological, and security constraints.

- **Wireless Ad Hoc and Underwater Sensor Networks:**  
  Design and optimization of energy-efficient routing, topology control, and communication strategies for terrestrial wireless ad hoc networks and underwater acoustic sensor networks. Research topics span network lifetime and energy-efficiency analysis, k-connectivity–based reliability, multi-sink architectures, void regions, adversarial effects (e.g., eavesdropping and sinkhole attacks), and operation under harsh and resource-constrained environments.

- **Hybrid Optimization and Learning-Based Network Control:**  
  Integration of mathematical optimization frameworks with machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to enable adaptive, data-driven, and scalable control of complex networked systems. Recent work explores hybrid optimization–learning methodologies for parameter prediction, dynamic decision-making, and emerging paradigms such as quantum network routing and hybrid classical–quantum architectures.
